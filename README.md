Crime Pattern Analysis is the comprehensive study of crime-related data to understand where, when, and how crimes occur. The objective is not merely to review past events but to extract actionable insights that can aid in forecasting and preventing future crimes. The relevance of such analysis lies in its ability to uncover invisible links between seemingly isolated crime events, revealing systemic issues or vulnerable zones within a community.
Traditional crime mapping has evolved significantly due to technological advances, particularly in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. These tools can process vast amounts of data in real-time, detect anomalies, and identify patterns that would otherwise be too complex for manual inspection.
The origins of crime analysis date back to the early days of criminology, where spatial maps were drawn manually. With the rise of data science, these maps have been transformed into interactive and intelligent platforms capable of deep analysis and predictive insights.
For this project, the primary goal is to utilize clustering techniques, such as KMeans and DBSCAN, and additional models including Agglomerative Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), to group crimes based on spatial characteristics. These methods allow for discovering latent structures in data, which can, in turn, inform policing strategies and urban planning efforts.
Additionally, this analysis aims to provide a visual and statistical understanding of crime distribution, helping not only enforcement agencies but also policymakers and community leaders in shaping a safer environment.
